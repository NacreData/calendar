            <p>Hello and welcome, comrades!  </p>

            <p>There are a couple different ways to contribute events to the calendar, but
            we encourage using this form (https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/edit/jTrXE53VJvraUFCkMr0A3kyD/) for the quickest turnaround. If you have your events require specific accomodations or if you have any questions, please email this project's maintainers to discuss
            integrating those.</p>

                <li>Thank you for contributing to our collective efforts in Knoxville. With your help, we're keeping Knox scruffy and connected.
